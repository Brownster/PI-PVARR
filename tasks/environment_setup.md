# Task 2: Environment Setup

Goal: create a reliable installation script and documentation for setting up development and production environments on Raspberry Pi (ARM) and x86_64 Debian systems.

## Subtasks
- Update or rewrite `install.sh` to install system packages (Docker, Docker Compose, Python tools, build-essential).
- Include logic to detect architecture and install appropriate Docker packages.
- Create a Python virtual environment and install requirements from `requirements.txt`.
- Document the setup process in `docs/INSTALLATION.md`.
- Test the script on both architectures.
