# Task 4: Backend/API Improvements

Goal: ensure the Flask API in `src/api/server.py` is stable, well-documented, and handles errors gracefully.

## Subtasks
- Review existing API modules for truncation or incomplete code, fixing as needed.
- Implement error handling and logging using Python's `logging` module.
- Provide REST endpoints for configuration management and container control.
- Serve static files from the `src/web` directory.
- Update or create unit tests for API routes.
