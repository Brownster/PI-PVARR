# Task 1: Repository Cleanup

Goal: remove truncated lines, shell prompts, and unfinished sections from all project files. Ensure each file has a clean ending newline.

## Subtasks
- Audit all source code, scripts, and documentation for shell prompts like `root@` or `$` and remove them.
- Fix incomplete sentences and ensure Markdown files render properly.
- Update `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` with full dependency lists.
- Verify that every file ends with a newline without terminal prompts.

## Notes
This task lays the groundwork for stable development. No functional changes should be made at this stage beyond cleaning up file contents.
