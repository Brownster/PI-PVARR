Client Brief: PI-PVR Testing Implementation

  Project Overview

  The PI-PVR platform is a sophisticated media server stack management system wwith modern ui designed for Raspberry Pi and other Linux systems. It provides an
  all-in-one solution for media management including download automation, media organization, and streaming capabilities. We need a comprehensive
  testing framework to ensure reliability and maintainability as development continues.
  TEST A YOU GO. THE CODE MUST BE DRY. THE CODE MUST BE WELL COMMENTED

  Objectives

  - Implement a robust testing infrastructure with 80% code coverage
  - Create a sustainable testing strategy that can grow with the codebase
  - Balance unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for optimal coverage
  - Focus initially on the critical backend Python API functionality
  - Ensure all tests can run in CI/CD environments

  Technical Requirements

  Test Framework Structure

  - Use pytest as the primary testing framework
  - Organize tests in a logical directory structure
  - Define a clear approach for mocking external dependencies
  - Implement fixtures for common test scenarios
  - Create a coverage reporting mechanism

  Primary Testing Areas (Phase 1)

  1. Backend API Testing
    - Focus on scripts/api.py and its core functions
    - Prioritize the complex installation process and Docker Compose generation
    - Test configuration management and environment setup
    - Implement service status monitoring tests
    - Test system information detection (CPU, memory, temperature, etc.)
    - Test Docker container management functions
  2. Installation Process Testing
    - Test Docker installation workflow
    - Test Tailscale integration
    - Test configuration file generation
    - Test Docker Compose generation for various service combinations
    - Test environment file creation
  3. Test Environment
    - Tests must be able to run without actual Docker or system dependencies
    - Mock responses for subprocess calls and file operations
    - Use fixtures to simulate different hardware configurations
    - Create mockups for Raspberry Pi and generic Linux environments

  Secondary Testing Areas (Phase 2)

  1. Frontend Testing
    - JavaScript function tests
    - API client integration tests
    - UI component rendering tests
    - Dashboard data handling
  2. End-to-End Testing
    - Complete installation workflows
    - Service management
    - Configuration changes
    - Container lifecycle management

  Implementation Guidelines

  - Begin with unit tests for focused code blocks
  - Progress to integration tests for complete workflows
  - Create mocks for system calls, Docker commands, and file operations
  - Implement parameterized tests for different configuration scenarios
  - Test error handling and edge cases thoroughly
  - Document test coverage gaps for future phases

  Deliverables

  1. Complete test suite with minimum 80% code coverage
  2. Detailed testing plan document outlining the strategy
  3. Test progress report indicating coverage metrics and improvements
  4. Documentation for future test implementation phases

  Success Criteria

  - All tests pass consistently in different environments
  - Coverage reaches at least 80% of backend code
  - Tests do not rely on physical hardware or Docker installations
  - Testing framework is maintainable and expandable
  - CI integration is possible with the test suite

  Timeline

  Implementation to be completed in phases:
  1. Phase 1: Backend API testing
  2. Phase 2: Frontend and JavaScript testing
  3. Phase 3: End-to-end testing and integration
  4. Phase 4: CI/CD integration and documentation

  Technical Stack

  - Backend: Python, Flask, Flask-CORS
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose
  - Testing: pytest, pytest-cov, unittest.mock
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions
